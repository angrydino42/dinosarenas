## What makes your Arenas different from every other mod?
My arenas are all experimental. In fact, some of these arenas are actually the worst things you will ever play in. If you decide to at all, of course.
For example, DA-Cramped is hell to traverse, has as many creatures as I could fit spawn, and makes your game freeze for 5 seconds every time it needs to load. 
DA-Rendering_Error is supposed to look like... well, a rendering error. The arena is different to *some things you may have seen in game* as it uses an actual palette and EffectColor instead of a rendering bug. 
There is also an unneccesary amount of Entity arenas. I will not deny that. 
DA-SB_Entity12x10 is based off the old Entity Testing Arena by ZombieMan101. Me and other ID hunters preferred the old version, so I made one that doesn't rely on an outdated mod that is no longer being updated.
